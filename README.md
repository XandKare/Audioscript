# Audioscript
 As part of the course "Global Startup Lab" at the University of Regensburg, an Android App was developed, that prepares study material (photos of physical docs or screenshots) as an audio book library. This allows students to study in situations, when their hands or eyes are busy (e.g. driving, showering, household).
